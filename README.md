# Python Directory Tree Implementation

## Description
This Python script simulates a directory tree, allowing users to create, move, delete, and list directories. It manages hierarchical paths and performs operations similar to a file system but operates entirely in memory.

## Requirements
- Python 3.6 or higher.

## Running the Script
1. Save the script as `main.py`.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the script is located.
3. Run the script using:

   ```bash
   python main.py
or
```bash
   python3 main.py
