Description
This Python script simulates a directory tree, allowing users to create, move, delete, and list directories. It handles hierarchical paths and performs operations similar to a file system but purely in memory.

Requirements
Python 3.6 or higher.
Running the Script
Save the script as directories.py.
Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the script is located.
Run the script using:
bash
Copy code
python directories.py
Output
The script will print the output according to the commands provided in the problem statement, showing how the virtual directory structure changes with each operation.

Notes
The directory structure is case-sensitive.
Directories are created, moved, and deleted only if they exist in the specified paths.
The output matches the exact format provided in the problem statement.
This solution should demonstrate clear code structure, separation of concerns, and robust handling of directory operations. Let me know if you have any questions or need further refinements!
